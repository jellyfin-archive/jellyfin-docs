## Browsers

Our goal is to provide support for the two most recent versions of these browsers.

- Firefox
- Firefox ESR
- Chrome
- Chrome for Android
- Safari for MacOS and iOS
- Edge

Older browsers may be supported as a result of the needs of specific web-based clients, but full functionality is not guaranteed on their desktop version.
