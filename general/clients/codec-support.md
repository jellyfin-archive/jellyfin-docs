# [Codec Tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_codecs "Wikipedia's list of all codecs")

The goal is to Direct Play all media. This means the container, video, audio and subtitles are all compatible with the client. If the media is incompatible for any reason, Jellyfin will use FFmpeg to [convert the media](http://howto-pages.org/ffmpeg/). Direct Stream will occur if the audio, container or subtitles happen to not be supported. If the video codec is unsupported, this will result in video transcoding. Subtitles can be tricky because they can cause Direct Stream (subtitles are remuxed) or video transcoding (burning in subtitles) to occur. This is the most intensive CPU component of transcoding. Decoding is less intensive than encoding.

<sup>1</sup>HEVC support is potentially available by offloading to the operating system, but this has not been tested.

<sup>2</sup>Android playback is currently broken. Client reports that HEVC is supported and attempts to Direct Stream.

<sup>3</sup>May be (partially) dependent on Hardware support (can be compensated with CPU decoding on Android). On Android most new Phones in the higher price range and many "4K" AndroidTV devices have VP9 hardwaredecoding support. Refer to you manufacturer for supported codecs.

<sup>4</sup>AV1 support is experimental and often too slow for CPU decoding and as of writing this (05.2020) there is no hardware support on most devices yet. Support on jellyfin is tracked in [jellyfin#3129](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/issues/3129).

## [Audio Compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_video_container_formats#Audio_coding_formats_support "Wikipedia's audio codec tables")

If the audio codec is unsupported or incompatible (such as playing a 5.1 channel stream on a stereo device), the audio codec must be transcoded. This is not nearly as intensive as video coding.

## [Subtitle Compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_video_container_formats#Subtitle/caption_formats_support "Wikipedia's subtitle codec tables")

Subtiles can be a subtle issue for transcoding. Containers have a limited number of subtitles that are supported. If subtitles need to be transcoded, it will happen one of two ways. They can be converted into another supported format that is supported by the browser or burned into the video due to the subtitle transcoding not being supported. Burning in subtitles the most intenstive method of transcoding due to two transcodings happening at once; applying the subtitle layer on top of the video layer. Here is a [breakdown](https://www.afterdawn.com/guides/archive/subtitle_formats_explained.cfm) of common subtitle formats.

||Format|TS|MP4<sup>1</sup>|MKV|AVI|

|MP4TT/TXTT|XML|❌|✅|❌|❌|
|PGSSUB|Picture|❌|❌|✅|❌|

<sup>1</sup>MP4 containers can only support one embedded subtitle stream. This does not affect external subtitles.

<sup>2</sup>VTT are supported in an [HLS Stream](https://helpx.adobe.com/adobe-media-server/dev/webvtt-subtitles-captions.html).

<sup>3</sup>DVB-SUB [(SUB + IDX)](https://forum.videohelp.com/threads/261451-Difference-between-SUB-and-IDX-file) is another name for VobSub files.

To extract subtitles, the following commands can be used. The section `0:s:0` means the first subtitle, so `0:s:1` would be the second subtitle.

### SSA Subtitles

```bash
ffmpeg -dump_attachment:t "" -i file.mkv -map 0:s:1 -c:s ass extracted-subtitle.ass
```

### Recorded OTA Content

```bash
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i "movie=Ronin (1998).ts[out+subcc]" -map 0:1  "Ronin (1998).srt"
```

### Forced Subtitles

"Forced subtitles are common on movies and only provide subtitles when the characters speak a foreign or alien language, or a sign, flag, or other text in a scene is not translated in the localization and dubbing process. In some cases, foreign dialogue may be left untranslated if the movie is meant to be seen from the point of view of a particular character who does not speak the language in question." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtitles#Categories)

## [Container Compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Containers)

If the container is unsupported, this will result in remuxing. The video and audio codec will remain intact, but wrapped in a supported container. This is the least intensive process. Most video containers will be remuxed to use the HLS streaming protocol and TS containers. Remuxing shouldn't be a concern even for an RPi3.

<sup>1</sup>MP4 containers are one of the few containers that will not remux.

<sup>2</sup>MKV containers can hold nearly any codec, but are not compatible with streaming in Firefox and will remux.

<sup>3</sup>MKV containers are improperly labeled as WebM in Firefox during playback.

<sup>4</sup>TS is one of the primary containers for streaming for Jellyfin.

<sup>5</sup>WebM and Ogg have limited codec support (by design) refer to [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Containers#WebM) for WebM and [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Containers#Ogg) for Ogg
