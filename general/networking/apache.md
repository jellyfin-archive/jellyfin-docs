## Apache HTTP Server Project

"The [Apache HTTP Server Project](https://httpd.apache.org/) is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and Windows. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP standards."

```conf

    ServerName DOMAIN_NAME

    # Comment to prevent HTTP to HTTPS redirect
    Redirect permanent / https://DOMAIN_NAME

If you encouter errors, you may have to enable `mod_proxy`, `mod_ssl`, `proxy_wstunnel` and `remoteip` support manually.

```bash
sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_http ssl proxy_wstunnel remoteip
```
