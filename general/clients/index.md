# Clients

Clients connect your devices to your Jellyfin server and let you view your content on any supported device. You can find a list of clients below with their current development status.

> [!NOTE]
> Many clients have no active maintainers at the moment. If you interested in helping out, please see our [contribution guide](xref:contrib-index) and feel free to contact us for more information!

Do you have a client that interfaces with Jellyfin and want to see it listed here? Please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-docs)!

## Browsers

Our goal is to provide support for the two most recent versions of these browsers. Older browsers may be supported, but are not guaranteed. 
 - Firefox
 - Firefox ESR
 - Chrome
 - Chrome for Android
 - Safari for MacOS and iOS
 - Edge (EdgeHTML and Chromium engines)

Older browsers may be supported as a result of the needs of specific web-based clients, but full functionality is not guaranteed on their desktop version.
