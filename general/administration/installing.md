# Installing

The Jellyfin project and its contributors offer a number of pre-built binary packages to assist in getting Jellyfin up and running quickly on multiple systems.

## Containers

[Open Container Initiative](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31213126/libcontainer-vs-docker-vs-ocf-vs-runc#31219102) is a form of virtualization. An image is similar to an ISO while a container is akin to a running VM.

> [!Note]
> There is currently an [issue](https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/788) with read-only mounts in Docker. If there are submounts within the main mount, the submounts are read-write capable.

Use host mode for networking in order to use DLNA or an HDHomeRun.

### Official Docker Hub

<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/jellyfin/jellyfin"><img alt="Docker Pull Count" src="https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/jellyfin/jellyfin.svg"></a>

The Jellyfin Docker image is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jellyfin/jellyfin/) for multiple architectures.

1. Get the latest image.
    `docker pull jellyfin/jellyfin`

2. Create directories on the host for persistent data storage.
    `mkdir /path/to/config`  
    `mkdir /path/to/cache`

3. Start the server.

```
docker run -d \
 --volume /path/to/config:/config \
 --volume /path/to/cache:/cache \
 --volume /path/to/media:/media \
 --user 1000:1000 \
 --net=host \
 --restart=unless-stopped \
 jellyfin/jellyfin
```

Alternatively, using docker-compose:

```
version: "3"
services:
  jellyfin:
    image: jellyfin/jellyfin
    user: 1000:1000
    network_mode: "host"
    volumes:
      - /path/to/config:/config
      - /path/to/cache:/cache
      - /path/to/media:/media
```

### Unraid Docker

An Unraid Docker template is available in the repository.

1. Open the unRaid GUI (at least unRaid 6.5) and click on the "Docker" tab.

2. Add the following line under "Template Repositories" and save the options.

`https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/blob/master/deployment/unraid/docker-templates`

3. Click "Add Container" and select "jellyfin".

4. Adjust any required paths and save.

### Kubernetes

A community project to deploy Jellyfin on Kubernetes-based platforms exists [at their repository](https://github.com/home-cluster/jellyfin-openshift). Any issues or feature requests related to deployment on Kubernetes-based platforms should be filed there.

## Windows (x86/x64)

Windows installers and builds in ZIP archive format are available [here](https://jellyfin.org/downloads/#windows).

> [!WARNING]
> If you installed a version prior to 10.4.0 using a PowerShell script, you will need to manually remove the service using the command `nssm remove Jellyfin` and uninstall the server by remove all the files manually. Also one might need to move the data files to the correct location, or point the installer at the old location.

> [!WARNING]
> The 32-bit or x86 version is not recommended. `ffmpeg` and its video encoders generally perform better as a 64-bit executable due to the extra registers provided. This means that the 32-bit version of Jellyfin is deprecated.

**Uninstall**

1. Stop the currently running server either via the dashboard or using the application icon.
1. Move the `.app` package to the trash.

**Deleting Configuation**

This will delete all settings and user information. This applies for the .app package and the portable version.

1. Delete the folder `~/.config/jellyfin/`
1. Delete the folder `~/.local/share/jellyfin/`

**Portable Version**

1. Download the latest version
1. Extract it into the Applications folder
1. Open Terminal and type `cd` followed with a space then drag the jellyfin folder into the terminal.
1. Type `./jellyfin` to run jellyfin.
1. Open your browser at http://localhost:8096

Closing the terminal window will end Jellyfin. Running Jellyfin in screen or tmux can prevent this from happening.

**Upgrading the Portable Version**

1. Download the latest version.
1. Stop the currently running server either via the dashboard or using CTRL+C in the terminal window.
1. Extract the latest version into Applications
1. Open Terminal and type `cd` followed with a space then drag the jellyfin folder into the terminal.

1. Open your browser at http://localhost:8096

**Uninstalling the Portable Version**

1. Stop the currently running server either via the dashboard or using CTRL+C in the terminal window.
1. Move `/Application/jellyfin-version` folder to the Trash. Replace version with the actual version number you are trying to delete.

**Using FFmpeg with the Portable Version**

The portable version doesn't come with FFmpeg by default. To install FFmpeg you can use homebrew or download the build from [Zeranoe](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/macos64/static/).

If using Zeranoe's build, extract it to the `/Applications/` folder.

Navigate to the Playback tab in the Dashboard and set the path to FFmpeg under FFmpeg Path.

## Linux (generic amd64)

Generic amd64 Linux builds in TAR archive format are available [here](https://jellyfin.org/downloads/#linux).

### Installation Process

Create a directory in /opt for jellyfin and its files, and enter that directory.

```bash
sudo mkdir /opt/jellyfin
cd /opt/jellyfin
```

Download the latest generic Linux build from the [release page](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/releases). The generic Linux build ends with "linux-amd64.tar.gz". The rest of these instructions assume version 10.4.3 is being installed (i.e. `jellyfin_10.4.3_linux-amd64.tar.gz`). Download the generic build, then extract the archive:

```bash
sudo wget https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/releases/download/v10.4.3/jellyfin_10.4.3_linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar xvzf jellyfin_10.4.3_linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Create a symbolic link to the Jellyfin 10.4.3 directory. This allows an upgrade by repeating the above steps and enabling it by simply re-creating the symbolic link to the new version.

```bash
sudo ln -s jellyfin_10.4.3 jellyfin
```

Create four sub-directories for Jellyfin data.

```bash
sudo mkdir data cache config log
```

If you are running Debian or a derivative, you can also download and install an ffmpeg release built specifically for Jellyfin. Be sure to download the latest release that matches your OS (4.2.1-3 for Debian Stretch assumed below).

```bash
sudo wget https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-ffmpeg/releases/download/v4.2.1-3/jellyfin-ffmpeg_4.2.1-3-stretch_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg --install jellyfin-ffmpeg_4.2.1-3-stretch_amd64.deb
```

If you run into any dependency errors, run this and it will install them and jellyfin-ffmpeg.

```bash
sudo apt install -f
```

Due to the number of command line options that must be passed, it is easiest to create a small script to run Jellyfin.

```bash
sudo nano jellyfin.sh
```

Then paste the following commands and modify as needed.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
JELLYFINDIR="/opt/jellyfin"
FFMPEGDIR="/usr/share/jellyfin-ffmpeg"

$JELLYFINDIR/jellyfin/jellyfin \
 -d $JELLYFINDIR/data \
 -C $JELLYFINDIR/cache \
 -c $JELLYFINDIR/config \
 -l $JELLYFINDIR/log \
 --ffmpeg $FFMPEGDIR/ffmpeg
```

Assuming you desire Jellyfin to run as a non-root user, chmod all files and directories to your normal login user and group. Also make the startup script above executable.

```bash
sudo chown -R user:group *
sudo chmod u+x jellyfin.sh
```

Finally you can run it. You will see lots of log information when run, this is normal. Setup is as usual in the web browser.

```bash
./jellyfin.sh
```

## Portable DLL

Platform-agnostic .NET Core DLL builds in TAR archive format are available [here](https://jellyfin.org/downloads/#portable). These builds use the binary `jellyfin.dll` and must be loaded with `dotnet`.

## Arch

Jellyfin is not yet available in the official repository but can be found [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/jellyfin-git/) in the user repository.

## Fedora

Fedora 29 builds in RPM package format are available [here](https://jellyfin.org/downloads/#fedora) for now but an official Fedora repository is coming soon.

## CentOS

CentOS/RHEL 7 builds in RPM package format are available [here](https://jellyfin.org/downloads/#centos) and an official CentOS/RHEL repository is planned for the future.

## Debian

### Repository

The Jellyfin team provides a Debian repository for installation on Debian Stretch/Buster. Supported architectures are `amd64`, `arm64`, and `armhf`.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft does not provide a .NET for 32-bit x86 Linux systems, and hence Jellyfin is not supported on the `i386` architecture.

1. Install HTTPS transport for APT if you haven't already:  
    `sudo apt install apt-transport-https`

1. Import the GPG signing key (signed by the Jellyfin Team):  
    `wget -O - https://repo.jellyfin.org/debian/jellyfin_team.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -`

1. Add a repository configuration at `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/jellyfin.list`:  
    `echo "deb [arch=$( dpkg --print-architecture )] https://repo.jellyfin.org/debian $( lsb_release -c -s ) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jellyfin.list`

> [!NOTE]
> Supported releases are `stretch` and `buster`.

1. Update APT repositories:  
    `sudo apt update`

1. Install Jellyfin:  
    `sudo apt install jellyfin`

    `sudo systemctl restart jellyfin`  
    `sudo /etc/init.d/jellyfin stop`  

### Packages

Raw Debian packages, including old versions, are available [here](https://jellyfin.org/downloads/#debian).

> [!NOTE]
> The repository is the preferred way to obtain Jellyfin on Debian, as it contains several dependencies as well.

1. Download the desired `jellyfin` and `jellyfin-ffmpeg` `.deb` packages from the repository.

1. Install the downloaded `.deb` packages:  
    `sudo dpkg -i jellyfin_*.deb jellyfin-ffmpeg_*.deb`

    `sudo /etc/init.d/jellyfin stop`  

## Ubuntu

### Migrating to the new repository

Previous versions of Jellyfin included Ubuntu under the Debian repository. This has now been split out into its own repository to better handle the separate binary packages. If you encounter errors about the `ubuntu` release not being found and you previously configured an `ubuntu` `jellyfin.list` file, please follow these steps.

1. Remove the old `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/jellyfin.list` file:  
    `sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jellyfin.list`

1. Proceed with the following section as written.
