# Clients

Clients connect your devices to your Jellyfin server and let you view your content on any supported device. You can find a list of clients below with their current development status.

**Note**: Many clients were direct forks of the latest available codebases from Emby, and some are not functional yet. If you interested in helping out, please see our [contribution guide](/contributor-docs/contributing).

Do you have a client that interfaces with Jellyfin and want to see it listed here? Please [submit a PR](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-docs)!

    * Select "Install from repository"
    * Choose "Kodi Jellyfin Addons"
    * "Video Add-ons"
    * Select the Jellyfin add-on and choose install
4. Within a few seconds you should be prompted for your server-details.
    * If a Jellyfin server is detected on your local network, it will displayed in the popup
    * If a Jellyfin server is not detected on your local network, select "Manually add server"
        * Enter the server name or IP address and the port number (default is 8096)
        * If using SSL and a reverse proxy, enter the full URL scheme in the "Host" field
            * Host: https://jellyfin.example.com
            * Port: 443

    * Choose your preferences for each option
    * Select "Proceed" to configure libraries

This will help keep your media libraries up to date without waiting for a periodic resync from Kodi.
