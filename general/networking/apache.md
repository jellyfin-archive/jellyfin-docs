## Apache HTTP Server Project

"The [Apache HTTP Server Project](https://httpd.apache.org/) is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and Windows. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP standards."

```conf
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName DOMAIN_NAME

    # Comment to prevent HTTP to HTTPS redirect
    Redirect permanent / https://DOMAIN_NAME

    ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/DOMAIN_NAME-error.log
    CustomLog /var/log/apache2/DOMAIN_NAME-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>

# If you are not using a SSL certificate, replace the 'redirect'
# line above with all lines below starting with 'Proxy'
<IfModule mod_ssl.c>
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName DOMAIN_NAME
    # This folder exists just for certbot(You may have to create it, chown and chmod it to give apache permission to read it)
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/jellyfin/public_html

    ProxyPreserveHost On

    # Letsencrypt's certbot will place a file in this folder when updating/verifying certs
    # This line will tell apache to not to use the proxy for this folder.
    ProxyPass "/.well-known/" "!"
    
    # Tell Jellyfin to forward that requests came from TLS connections
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Port "443"

    ProxyPass "/socket" "ws://SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:8096/socket"
    ProxyPassReverse "/socket" "ws://SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:8096/socket"

    ProxyPass "/" "http://SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:8096/"
    ProxyPassReverse "/" "http://SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:8096/"

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/DOMAIN_NAME/fullchain.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/DOMAIN_NAME/privkey.pem
    Protocols h2 http/1.1

    # Enable only strong encryption ciphers and prefer versions with Forward Secrecy
    SSLCipherSuite HIGH:RC4-SHA:AES128-SHA:!aNULL:!MD5
    SSLHonorCipherOrder on

    # Disable insecure SSL and TLS versions
    SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3 -TLSv1 -TLSv1.1

    ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/DOMAIN_NAME-error.log
    CustomLog /var/log/apache2/DOMAIN_NAME-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
</IfModule>
```

If you encouter errors, you may have to enable `mod_proxy`, `mod_ssl`, `proxy_wstunnel`, `http2` and `remoteip` support manually.

```bash
sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_http ssl proxy_wstunnel remoteip http2
```

## Apache with Subpath (example.org/jellyfin)

When connecting to server from a client application, enter `http(s)://DOMAIN_NAME/jellyfin` in the address field.

Set the [base URL](xref:network-index#base-url) field in the Jellyfin server.  This can be done by navigating to the Admin Dashboard -> Networking -> Base URL in the web client.  Fill in this box with `/jellyfin` and click Save.  The server will need to be restarted before this change takes effect.

> [!WARNING]
> HTTP is insecure. The following configuration is provided for ease of use only. If you are planning on exposing your server over the Internet you should setup HTTPS. [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/) can provide free TLS certificates which can be installed easily via [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).

The following configuration can be saved in ```/etc/httpd/conf/extra/jellyfin.conf``` and included in your vhost.

```conf
# Jellyfin hosted on http(s)://DOMAIN_NAME/jellyfin
<Location /jellyfin/socket>
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass "ws://127.0.0.1:8096/jellyfin/socket"
    ProxyPassReverse "ws://127.0.0.1:8096/jellyfin/socket"
</Location>
<Location /jellyfin>
    ProxyPass "http://127.0.0.1:8096/jellyfin"
    ProxyPassReverse "http://127.0.0.1:8096/jellyfin"
</Location>
```

After updating the configuration, you will need to restart apache to apply the change. After restarting apache AND Jellyfin to apply the baseurl setting, it may take some seconds for the services to finish restarting. It may also not be possible to connect to the Jellyfin server by IP address after this change. Should you need to revert the changes manually if your proxying fails, the configuration files (for Ubuntu at least) are found at: /etc/jellyfin
