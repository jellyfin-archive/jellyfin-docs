## Nginx

"[Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) (pronounced "engine X") is a web server which can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache. The software was created by Igor Sysoev and first publicly released in 2004.[9] A company of the same name was founded in 2011 to provide support and Nginx plus paid software." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx)

Create the file `/etc/nginx/conf.d/jellyfin.conf` which will forward requests to Jellyfin.

> [!WARNING]
> This is just an example! Please read up on networking and port forwarding before you expose anything past your router.

## Nginx with Subpath

When connecting to server from a client application, enter `http(s)://DOMAIN_NAME/jellyfin` in the address field.

Set the base URL field in the Jellyfin server.  This can be done by navigating to the Admin Dashboard -> Networking -> Base URL in the web client.  Fill in this box with `/jellyfin` and click Save.  The server will need to be restarted before this change takes effect.

```conf
# Jellyfin hosted on http(s)://DOMAIN_NAME/jellyfin

server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    server_name DOMAIN_NAME;
    # You can specify multiple domain names if you want
    #server_name jellyfin.local;

    # Uncomment and create directory to also host static content
    #root /srv/http/media;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    # Jellyfin
    location /jellyfin {
        return 302 $scheme://$host/jellyfin/;
    }

    location /jellyfin/ {
        # Proxy main Jellyfin traffic

        # The / at the end is significant.

        proxy_pass http://SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:8096/jellyfin/;

        proxy_pass_request_headers on;

        proxy_set_header Host $host;

        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;

        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $http_host;

        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection;

        # Disable buffering when the nginx proxy gets very resource heavy upon streaming
        proxy_buffering off;
    }
